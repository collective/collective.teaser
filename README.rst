Teaser/Banner content type for Plone

This Plone add-on installs the content type teaser, which is meant to be used
for small advertisements on a homepage, which advert own or external content.
Randomly selected teasers will be shown in a Teaser portlet. An importance
level controls the frequency, how often teasers are shown - a teaser with higher
importance will be shown more frequently. Teasers can have an alternative
image (e.g. to have a horizontal and vertical version of the same teaser), that
can be prefered in portlets. If more teasers are shown in portlets on a page,
one teaser isn't shown twice.
