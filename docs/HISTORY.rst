- Remove alternative image field, which was meant to allow a portlet to select
  an Landscape/Portrait image from the same teaser. The meaning of the option
  was unclear. Instead, upload two different Teasers and select different
  importance levels for it.

- Option to get Teasers via AJAX call. This makes the teaser portlet better
  cachable.
