Changelog
=========

2.0dev (unreleased)
-------------------

- Furthur simplify the portlet options. No show_title or show_description
  options any more, instead override the portlet template via jbot or do some
  css styling, if you need to.
  [thet]

- Remove alternative image field, which was meant to allow a portlet to select
  an Landscape/Portrait image from the same teaser. The meaning of the option
  was unclear. Instead, upload two different Teasers and select different
  importance levels for it.
  [rnix, thet]

- Option to get Teasers via AJAX call. This makes the teaser portlet better
  cachable.
